<h1>Simple RSS Reader for Android</h1>
==============

<p>The task of this Android app is to read out an rss feed and redirect the user to the website of the according post.
<br>
It does it by using a static url for the feed and reaing the xml data which is given by the rss feed and displays it in a simple listview.
<br>
The user can select a listitem and is then redirected to a webview, which shows the aricle connected to the rss entry.
</p>

<p><b>+++The app works but there is still a lot to do</b>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Custom Adapter for multiple rows in listview</li>
<li>Item style with selector</li>
<li>TabMenu to choose different rss feeds</li>
</ul>
